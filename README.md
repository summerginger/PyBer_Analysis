# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
  This report applied Pandas and Matplotlib to create a ride-sharing summary data frame and a multiple-line graph showing the total fares for each city type. 

### The purpose 
  
  The purpose of this new analysis is to provide the differences between the ride-sharing information which decision-makers can use to improve the places' access and affordability   at Pyber.

## Results

  The table shows the information of the ride-sharing data among urban, suburban and rural areas.
 ![table](https://github.com/summerginger/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/table.png)
  The ride-sharing data clearly shows that the urban gets the highest numbers in total rides, the total drivers, and the total fares, three times that of the suburban and ten to     twenty times that of the rural area. However, the average cost per ride and the average fare per driver is the highest in the rural area.
  Overall, the farther distance from the urban the fewer rides, and yet the higher fare, the more fare the average driver gets.

  The line chart shows that the highest fare between the three city types begins in the middle of February. 
  Based on this information, we believe this may also the busiest time for the drivers. Therefore, the same situation is expected to happen in the coming year.

## Summary

  To conclude, three suggestions are provided in hoping to address the disparities:

  1-	 Promote rural riding service by adding more drivers, especially during the busy month.

  2-	Offer coupons to the rural riders to balance high prices to promote the services in rural areas.

  3-	Set the rating and reasons for users to use the app in order to make a better promotion and prediction plan in the future.
